Medication Database for varying Illnesses
Elisabeth Johnson


Abstract

The aim of this project is to provide an avenue for people (and doctors!) to either refresh their memory on, or learn more about, which prescriptions are available for different illnesses. This project also aims to address any confusion or hesitancy people may have towards certain prescriptions by providing them with real and honest reviews about various prescriptions for any illness within the WebMD database tailored to their risk level. With this app people are able to filter by illness and ease of use tolerance level in order to understand which prescriptions may work best for them!


Design

For this project I used SQLite as a data storage platform and python in order to 1) connect to my database in SQLite and 2) connect to StreamLit for web application development. In Addition to this I used unit testing in order ensure that my code was functional. 


Data

The data I used for this project was obtained from Kaggle and can be found here. 

Algorithms

For this project I used Exploratory Data analysis and classical data cleaning techniques. 

Communication

This project was developed in StreamLit as an interactive web app.
